# Pond
My first OpenGL project.\
Pond is a modified boids simulation with procedural animation.

## Features
- Transparent background
- Fishies are always there to keep you company :D (fish always visible on screen, to close the simulation focus the window and press Esc)

![Example](github_stuff/screenshot.png?raw=true)

## Installation
### Ubuntu based
Clone the repo and make a build folder in which you will compile and run the project with cmake:
```
git clone https://github.com/SteveMCWin/pond.git
cd pond
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
To run the project, run `./my_opengl_project` in the build folder.
